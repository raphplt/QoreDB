This project is QoreDB, a modern local-first desktop database client that unifies SQL and NoSQL. 
All work must respect: 
- Simplicity over feature count 
- Speed and responsiveness over abstraction 
- UX clarity over technical cleverness 
- Privacy-first, local-first by default 
- Designed for developers (not data analysts, not DBAs)
Never propose features or architecture that turn QoreDB into: 
- a BI tool - a dashboarding platform 
- a SaaS-first product 
- an enterprise DBA suite
